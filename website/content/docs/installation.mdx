## Package Manager

Install using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# bun
bun add @sylphx/gust

# npm
npm install @sylphx/gust

# pnpm
pnpm add @sylphx/gust

# yarn
yarn add @sylphx/gust
```

## Choose Your Package

Gust is modular. Choose what you need:

### Full Server (Recommended)

For maximum performance with native Rust acceleration:

```bash
bun add @sylphx/gust
```

This includes both the app framework and the high-performance server.

### Portable App Only

For serverless/edge deployments where you bring your own server:

```bash
bun add @sylphx/gust-app
```

Use with `Bun.serve()`, `Deno.serve()`, or any fetch-compatible runtime.

### Server Features Only

For advanced server features without the app framework:

```bash
bun add @sylphx/gust-server
```
